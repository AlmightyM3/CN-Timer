# CN-Timer
The goal of this project is to create a better timer system for use at a Code Ninjas, allowing the students to accurately see how long is left intill free time with less work on the part of the senseis. A secondary goal is to allow more customizability than the previous timer system we were using. 

# TO-DO:
- State whether or not it is free time.
- Upgrade font selection system.
- Make the icon transparent.
- Ensure unnecessary libraries aren't included in build.
- Comment code.
- Additional customization options?
- Display actual time?
